# Mask-Detecting-Project
Worked on AI using Python with InMovidu. I had taken up the challenge to learn about Artificial Intelligence using Python. While learning about the concepts
of AI through a simple project, I gained a lot of interest in the world of AI. 

I worked on designing a mask detection program using python. I selected a data set of people wearing a mask and people not wearing a mask. Using multiple libraries such as Keras, os, numpy, cv2, sklearn, & matplotlib. Using the cocnept of train and test features, we tested the accuracy of the program. I also used Keras optimizer (Adam) to optimise the program to get better accuracy and results. With the help of cv2 library, I accessed webcam to detect the face of a person. 

Here is how the final output looked like:

![With mask](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71218661/202376841-c0a26268-24aa-4627-8ca3-85e79607091f.png)


Check the src folder & Data folder for the code and the data set used for this program. While using the code, make sure to replace ----- on line numbers 17 and 19 with your file path of the data set folder. However, this is not enough. I wish to continue working and updating my program from time to time to get the best results from it. Please do come up with suggestions and let me know about changes that could help me make it better.
